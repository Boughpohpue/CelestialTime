# CelestialTime

CelestialTime is a C# class library that provides deterministic solar and lunar calculations based on a given DateTime and geographic location.
It exposes a set of DateTime extension methods and immutable data models to compute sun events (sunrise, sunset, day/night length), moon phases, lunar age, illumination, and approximate eclipse timing with a clean, expressive API.
